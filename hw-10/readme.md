####  Summary

The variant calling analysis of SRR2584863 yielded 4,318,567 total records.
The Key findings include 34,607 SNPs and 278 (indels). Most sites (4,283,682) matched the reference, with a transition/transversion (Ts/Tv) ratio of 2.54, which indicates high confidence in the variant quality. 
Depth was high across most variants, showing reliability, with A>G and G>A substitutions being the most common.
